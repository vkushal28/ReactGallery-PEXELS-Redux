- Used [redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) for state management
- "Load more" button to fetch next page and add the new objects to main array
- A scroll to top button to directly go to top, and it always float above everything
- Just change the "API_KEY" in path "ReactGridGallery-Pexels/src/api/pexelsApi.js" with yours
